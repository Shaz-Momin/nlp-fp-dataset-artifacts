But that is different than the notion that they must go to jail as part of a rule connected with civil disobedience. The key point is that the spirit of protest should be maintained all the way, whether it is done by remaining in jail, or by evading it. To accept jail penitently as an accession to 'the rules' is to switch suddenly to a spirit of subservience, to demean the seriousness of the protest...In particular, the neo-conservative insistence on a guilty plea should be eliminated.\" Some people go to jail for disobedience.", "question": "Why do some people chose to go to jail for their disobedience?", "answers": {"text": ["a way of continuing their protest", "continuing their protest", "a way of continuing their protest", "a way of continuing their protest", "a way of continuing their protest"], "answer_start": [86, 95, 86, 86, 86]}, "predicted_answer": "as a way of continuing their protest, as a way of reminding their countrymen of injustice"}

This can be explained by the fact that as the poor people in the society become more wealthy, it increases their yearly carbon emissions. This relation is expressed by the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC).[not in citation given] It should be noted here however that in certain cases, with great economic inequality, there is nonetheless not more waste and pollution created as the waste/pollution is cleaned up better afterwards (water treatment, filtering, ...).... Also note that the whole of the increase in environmental degradation is the result of the increase of emissions per person being multiplied by a multiplier. If there were fewer people however, this multiplier would be lower, and thus the amount of environmental degradation would be lower as well. As such, the current high level of population has a large impact on this as well. If (as WWF argued), population levels would start to drop to a sustainable level (1/3 of current levels, so about 2 billion people), human inequality can be addressed/corrected, while still not resulting in an increase of environmental damage. Poverty can be addressed without increasing environmental damage with fossil fuels.", "question": "How could human inequality be addressed without resulting in an increase of environmental damage?", "answers": {"text": ["If (as WWF argued), population levels would start to drop to a sustainable level", "If (as WWF argued), population levels would start to drop to a sustainable level", "population levels would start to drop to a sustainable level", "population levels would start to drop to a sustainable level"], "answer_start": [987, 987, 1007, 1007]}, "predicted_answer": "corrected"}

By 1700, one-fifth of the city's population was French speaking. The Berlin Huguenots preserved the French language in their church services for nearly a century. They ultimately decided to switch to German in protest against the occupation of Prussia by Napoleon in 1806-07. Many of their descendents rose to positions of prominence. Several congregations were founded, such as those of Fredericia (Denmark), Berlin, Stockholm, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Helsinki, and Emden.
