This can be explained by the fact that as the poor people in the society become more wealthy, it increases their yearly carbon emissions. This relation is expressed by the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC).[not in citation given] It should be noted here however that in certain cases, with great economic inequality, there is nonetheless not more waste and pollution created as the waste/pollution is cleaned up better afterwards (water treatment, filtering, ...).... Also note that the whole of the increase in environmental degradation is the result of the increase of emissions per person being multiplied by a multiplier. If there were fewer people however, this multiplier would be lower, and thus the amount of environmental degradation would be lower as well. As such, the current high level of population has a large impact on this as well. If (as WWF argued), population levels would start to drop to a sustainable level (1/3 of current levels, so about 2 billion people), human inequality can be addressed/corrected, while still not resulting in an increase of environmental damage. Human equality can be addressed without increasing environmental damage.", "question": "How could human inequality be addressed without resulting in an increase of environmental damage?", "answers": {"text": ["If (as WWF argued), population levels would start to drop to a sustainable level", "If (as WWF argued), population levels would start to drop to a sustainable level", "population levels would start to drop to a sustainable level", "population levels would start to drop to a sustainable level"], "answer_start": [987, 987, 1007, 1007]}, "predicted_answer": "Human equality"}
